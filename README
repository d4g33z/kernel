If you want to configure/compile your kernel as a user and install it as root,
usually several standard commands should be entered.
I got bored of typing these over and over and thus have written a convenient
script to automate this task.

This POSIX shell script is optimized for usage under Gentoo with portage
(and can use app-portage/eix to speed up): It uses portage to determine some
default paths and settings; it is currently untested in different environments.

You must have push.sh from http://github.com/vaeth/push in your path.

This script requires that you have set KBUILD_OUTPUT so that the
output really can occur as a user. (You should set it also in the root
environment or in make.conf to the same value so that ebuilds will
honour that place).

If you want to transfer X data, you should also have the sudox script from
http://github.com/vaeth/sudox in your path.

For installation, copy kernel with executable permission in your path.
There is also an ebuild in the mv overlay (which is available by layman).
